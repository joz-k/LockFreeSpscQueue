    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out repository code.

        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Configure the project using CMake.
      # This step is now run on each OS. The commands are cross-platform.
      # We use a Debug build for tests as it provides more info on failures.

      # Step 3: Build the project.
      # The '--config Debug' flag is crucial for multi-configuration generators
      # like Visual Studio on Windows. It is ignored by single-configuration
      # generators like Makefiles on Linux and macOS, making this command
      # robustly cross-platform.
      - name: Build Project
        run: cmake --build build --config Debug

      # Step 4: Run the tests.
      # The '-C Debug' flag tells ctest to look for test executables in the
      # 'Debug' configuration subdirectory, which is necessary on Windows.
      # Like the build command, this is safely ignored on other platforms.
